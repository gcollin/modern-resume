   A great progression of my career in an always changing environment
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Agcs SE is a relatively new fully owned subsidiary of Allianz SE, handling 9B€ premiums annually with a constant evolution.

    While supporting multiple project architectures worldwide, I challenge myself in introducing new technologies (Angular, Mongo, ESB, Kafka...) or concepts (DevOps, Toolchain, Configuration as Code, Microservices...) to the company.

    For other innovations like Digital Signature, I don't hesitate to work with multiple departments (legal, data privacy, underwriting, market mgt, access mgt) to ensure smooth integrations with company's constraints and regulations.

    As a recognized leader, I'm the local manager for IT in France, and team leader of up to 7 architects worldwide.
