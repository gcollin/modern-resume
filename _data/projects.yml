    As an Technical Enterprise Architect Manager, I'm moving a 9B€ insurance company to new technologies and producing benefits at every step.
    - Web architecture: In 2019, one year before AGCS decided on creating a new customer portal, I had the application architecture, components, design principles already defined in conjunction with design leads, making me the obvious choice to be the system architect of this 20+ milliions € project.
    - Integration architecture: When I arrived in 2010, each project in AGCS where defining its own integrations. I defined a solution based on ESB, got it approved by the board, setup and ran an integration team, becoming since then a critical part of the landscape. Now implementing next level with Kafka
    - Inclusive strategy: I always make sure the technical strategy defined fits with the historical, organizational and Allianz Group Architecture boundaries. Very often, Group Architects made the same choice than me !
