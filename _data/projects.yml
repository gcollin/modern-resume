    As an Technical Enterprise Architect Manager, I'm moving a 9B€ insurance company to new technologies while generating benefits at every step.
    - <mark>Web architecture:</mark> In 2019, one year before AGCS decided to initiate a new customer portal project, I had the architecture, components, design principles already defined in collaboration with design leads, then I introduced Web Agencies to Agcs, making me the obvious choice as system architect of this 20+ millions € project.
    - <mark>Integration architecture:</mark> When I arrived in 2010, each project where defining its own integration mechanism. I defined a solution based on ESB, got it approved by the board, setup and ran an integration team. This now the default integration platform, lowering the company effort and budget. Now implementing next level with Kafka.
    - <mark>Inclusive strategy:</mark> I always make sure the technical strategy defined fits with the historical, organizational and Allianz Group Architecture boundaries. Very often, Group Architects made the same choice than me !

    Amongst the thousands of new products and concepts on the market, only a few fits with my company needs. Once selected, me and my team develop proof of concepts, present them to managers, contact vendors / conduct RFPs, sell solutions to projects. Here are some of the successful innovations:
    - <mark>Angular:</mark> I switched our company from a proprietary front end technology to Angular by demoing and prototyping over an [already made design](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/angle-bootstrap-admin-template-WB04HF123). People were astonished !
    - <mark>Mongo:</mark> Out of the vibrant NoSql market, I selected Mongo as it combines the best of both relational and non-relational. After a study with vendor support, I eventually convinced a project to use it for their 10TB+ datawarehouse, this in turns forced the infrastructure team to support it. It's now used by multiple projects and becomes an Allianz standard.
    - <mark>Kafka:</mark> After ESB becomes as standard integration platform, I've now moved the needle to persistent streaming technologies and introduced Kafka as the engine. Our main datawarehouse platform and portal project are adopting it, and I achieved broad agreement for it to become the next AGCS global integration layer.

    - <mark>Digital Signature:</mark> It all started with a selection of vendor with Allianz SE. I though this would benefit substantially AGCS but the company is reluctant to adopt it. So I setup a small team of volunteers, and we reached out to data privacy officer, convinced legal team this was valid and conducted trainings. This is now being used worldwide !
    - <mark>Team setup:</mark>Back in 2013, there were no architecture teams in AGCS. With the newly appointed Head of Global Technical Architecture, I've recruited 7 persons in 4 countries, managed them to become key players in projects worldwide.
    - <mark>IT Leader:</mark>When the head of IT France left in 2018, I have been selected to replace him as local manager of 14 people. Now I'm supporting the whole Mediterranean and African businesses.
    - <mark>DevOps Leader:</mark>When Allianz SE provided a self-service private cloud, I was the first to jump in and to make it available for Agcs. Now we have an international team of 6 persons supporting all projects in their transformations to DevSecOps.
